====================
CHANGES: optcomplete
====================

Current
-------

- ''xml-victorinox rename current/'' would not complete by listing the directory
  for the xml files... RegexCompleter.__call__ has been changed to have an extra
  argument to always list the subdirectories, and also can list subdirectories
  in prefixes, so you can complete ``dir/partial_filename``.

Version 1.2
-----------

- Following a user's suggestion, changed license to BSD-style license so that it
  is compatible with the Python code and optparse.

Version 1.1
-----------

- Added setup.py
- Implemented support for --opt=<TAB> syntax to work.
- Implemented support for subcommands, fixed bugs.
- Implemented more completers
- [2004-01-27] Added ListCompleter, while writing support for scripts with
  subcommands.


Version 1.0
-----------

- Initial public release.
